# VK friend analysis app

This app can collect data on the number of likes and comments in VK. That is, for a friend, the app counts how many likes and comments it has for each of the other friends.
##### !!! It uses only the information that is available to you. !!!

# Installation
1. Go to https://vk.com/apps?act=manage. Click "Create", type title and select platform - "Standalone app".
2. Go to section "Settings", and find <b>App ID</b> (for example, 1234567).</br>
Using the address bar go to link https://oauth.vk.com/authorize?client_id=1234567&display=page&redirect_uri=https://oauth.vk.com/blank.html&scope=friends,offline&response_type=token&v=5.52, replacing 1234567 on your token. Than click "Allow".
The access_token value is your token. It may look like:
